# Aviation-Engine-Anomaly-Detection

Final goal: Physics-Informed Transformer for Aviation Engine Failure Detection. 

Current progress: Splitted data into training, validation, thresholding, and testing datasets. Finished a LSTM for regression.  

Current goal: visualize metrics against different thresholds. Try to match performance results in this [paper](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2025-2324).
